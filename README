"aws" is a command line program that accesses Amazon Web Services.
The orignal author is Timothy Kay, and the original source and documentation
can be found at http://timkay.com/aws/.

My fork contains patches and YAML support (aws --yaml [--ruby] foobar).
  master:    my active branch
  test_yaml: private work to test YAML support

For more documentation, see http://timkay.com/aws/

If you can help improve the "aws" documentation, please let me know.
